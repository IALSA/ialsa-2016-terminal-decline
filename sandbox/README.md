`./sandbox/` Directory
=========

This directory contains dynamic reports. A report (or family of reports using the same .R file) are congregated in separate folders. Once a dymic report is developed sufficiently to justify ongoing support it is moved to the `./reports/` Directory, becoming one of the information displays published by the project.
